# Contribution Policy

We welcome contributions via pull requests. To maintain a high-quality codebase:

- Develop on topic branches and keep commits focused.
- Follow the coding style and design principles described in `AGENTS.md`.
- Include tests and documentation for all changes.
- Ensure the entire test suite passes before requesting review.

## Using AI Productively

AI tools can assist with drafts and repetitive tasks, but contributors remain responsible for the result:

- Treat AI output as a starting point and verify it carefully.
- Retain ownership of the code; review and understand every line you submit.
- Run the full test suite and ensure compliance with licensing and security guidelines.
- Note in pull requests when substantial portions were AI-assisted.

By contributing, you agree to abide by these principles and maintain the project's standards of excellence.
